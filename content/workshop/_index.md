# Workshop de AWS Robomaker 

En este workshop, te vamos a familiarizar con AWS Robomaker, un servicio que ...

you become familiar with AWS RoboMaker, a service that enables you to easily develop, simulate and deploy intelligent robot applications that integrate with AWS services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. Today, you will also get hands on with a physical robot (Robotis TurtleBot 3 Burger) to learn how to manage and deploy robot applications to production robots using AWS RoboMaker.

RoboMaker extends the most widely used open-source robotics software framework **Robot Operating System**, or [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). Therefore, this workshop will include references to ROS concepts and tools. No previous ROS experience is required, however, if you would like to learn more check out the [ROS website](http://www.ros.org/).

**Here is our agenda for the day:**

**(1) [Pre-workshop Setup](setup/)**

We will start by setting up your AWS account to develop robot applications with AWS RoboMaker. 

**(2) [Hello Robot: Development Environment and HelloWorld](helloworld/)**

In this activity you will setup a development environment and build, bundle, and simulate a "Hello World" application.

**(3) [Find Fido: Integrating Cloud APIs](dogfinder/)**

In this activity you will explore other methods for building and deploying applications in the development environment, and see how an application can directly interact with AWS services in a ROS native manner (nodes and topics), and how any AWS service can be used through normal SDK calls (python boto3 in this instance).

**(4) [Deploy Hello World Robot Code](deploy/)**

In this activity you will explore how to configure a robot and a fleet, and deploy a software bundle to your physical robot.

**(5) [Clean-up](cleanup/)**

Please read through and complete each activity before starting the next. If something doesn't look correct, ask for assistance as we want to make sure the concept covered are well understood. Also, if you find a bug - submit a pull request!

Excited to build a robot using AWS? Let's get started!

**Once all activities are done, please then complete the account cleanup section at the bottom of this page.**
